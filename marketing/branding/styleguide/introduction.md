## OSGeo brand

<div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"><p>This document contains the collected elements of the new **[OSGeo](http://osgeo.org)** visual identity and provides guidelines for their use. This is a toolkit designed to help us create more consistent visual communications pieces. The system is both unifying and extensible allowing enough diversity to meet the demands presented by different audiences and applications while maintaining a consistent visual character that is both distinct and concise.

**An Identity is more than a logo, typeface or color**.  
When used thoughtfully and consistently, our identity becomes the unified voice of our organization. With so many variables, this style guide should be used to ensure brand consistency for current and
future use.</p></div><div class="col-md-4"><img src="img/osgeo-emblem-cmyk.svg"/></div></div>


## Styleguide

This is the HTML version of the **OSGeo branding styleguide** built on top of [mdwiki](http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!index.md). Content is written into  markdown files from which the top and sidebar menu are generated. Some additional inline HTML markup is included in the markdown to improve the styleguide presentation and correctly meet the guidelines.

This ocument is an entry point to the OSGeo branding assets and guidelines. Every material and content is available on [Github](https://github.com/OSGeo/osgeo/tree/master/marketing/branding), so feel free to reuse it and please help us to make it better !
