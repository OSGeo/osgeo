# Subbrands

Please check the [style guide](styleguide-osgeo.pdf) for examples of subbrands use.

Subbrands make use of the OSGeo mark, combined with text denoting the OSGeo community, initiative, award or recognition.

Text has been reduced to outlines for use on systems that do not have the correct fonts available. 

## Instructions for Template Use

Am adobe illustrator template has been provided for the generation of additional sub-brand logos, this has been converted to SVG for use in a wider range of applications.

To use the template you will need to:

1. Install the correct fonts on your system
2. Open up the adobe illustrator or SVG template in your graphics program

4. Convert the text into a series of shapes

## About "unused" Subbrands

The sub-brands listed in these folders were generated at the start of the website/rebranding process. Many of these did not end up being used either on the website or by their respective communities.

* GeoForAll decided not to use an OSGeo sub-brand, opting instead update their logo by maintaining their distinct emblem and adopting the new OSGeo font and branding colors
* OSGeoLive also decided to adopt a distinct brand with their own emblem and OSGeo font and branding colors. OSGeoLive branding is maintained in the [OSGeoLive documentation repository](https://github.com/OSGeo/OSGeoLive-doc/tree/master/images/osgeolive-logo).
* Case-Studies were replaced by resources on the website in order to attract a wider range of contributions from our community. This idea did not represent require a subbrand.

Consider these folders to contain examples of using the subbrand template and check with the respective community before use.
